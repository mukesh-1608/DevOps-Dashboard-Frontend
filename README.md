# Prism / DevOps Automation Dashboard


##  Overview

**Prism** is a high-performance, aesthetically engineered frontend interface for modern DevOps pipelines. Designed with a **"Phantom Glass"** aesthetic, it provides a mission-control style environment for developers to provision infrastructure, monitor deployments, and manage server logs.

The interface prioritizes clarity, minimizing visual noise while retaining a premium, technical feel using **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Flowbite**.
